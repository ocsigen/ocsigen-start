[%%shared.start]
(** This module provides functions to display messages (client-side or
    server-side).
 *)

val msg
  :  ?level:[`Err | `Msg]
  -> ?duration:float
  -> ?onload:bool
  -> string
  -> unit
(** Call this function either from client or server side
    to display an error message in the page.

    The message is displayed in a special box (a ["div"] with id ["os_msg"]
    created automatically in the body of the page).

    It is displayed during a short amount of time then disappears. You may
    change the duration in seconds with the parameter [duration] (default can
    be set using function {!Os_msg.set_default_duration}).

    The two levels correspond to different classes that you can
    personalize by modifying the CSS class ["os_err"] (added for error messages
    to the box with ID ["os_msg"]).

    If [?onload] is [true], the message is displayed after the next page
    is displayed (default [false]). When called on server side, this is
    always the case.
*)

[%%server.start]

val set_default_duration : float -> unit
(** Set default message duration (default 4s) *)

val action_link_key_created : bool Eliom_reference.Volatile.eref
(** Set to [true] if an action link key has been already created and sent to the
    user email, else [false]. Default is [false]. *)

val wrong_pdata
  : ((string * string) * (string * string)) option Eliom_reference.Volatile.eref
(** [((firstname, lastname), (password, password_confirmation)) option]
    is a reference used to remember information about the user during a
    request when something went wrong (for example in a form when the password
    and password confirmation are not the same).

    If the value is [None], no user data has been set. Default is [None].
