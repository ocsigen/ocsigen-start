# How the Ocsigen Start documentation is generated

The Ocsigen Start documentation published at
<https://ocsigen.org/ocsigen-start/> is built with **odoc** and themed with the
Ocsigen site chrome by [**wodoc**](https://github.com/ocsigen/wodoc) (an odoc
driver). The same odoc sources are also what ocaml.org renders.

Ocsigen Start is a **client/server** project: it ships its server and client
APIs as two libraries of the same package (`ocsigen-start.server` /
`ocsigen-start.client`) with the **same module names**, so `dune build @doc`
collides. The API is therefore built with `odoc_driver ocsigen-start --remap`
(the engine ocaml.org uses) on the **installed** package — i.e. the documented
version is whatever the build switch has installed.

## Sources

| What | Where | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Manual | the package's `(documentation)` `.mld` (`doc/*.mld`) | odoc pages |
| Manual nav | the static `(nav …)` in [`doc/wodoc`](wodoc) | wodoc config |
| Server / client API | the installed `ocsigen-start.server` / `.client` libraries | odoc comments |
| Site configuration | [`doc/wodoc`](wodoc) | wodoc config (S-expression) |

The whole site — per-side API navs, the client/server switch, the body colour,
the shared manual nav, and the rewriting of sibling Ocsigen projects' cross-refs
to relative links — is declared in [`doc/wodoc`](wodoc) and produced by a single
`wodoc build`. There is **no `build.sh`** and no Python.

## Build

`wodoc build` documents the **installed** `ocsigen-start`, so install it first
(from the ref you want to document) in a switch that also has `wodoc`:

```
opam install .                       # the version to document (NOT --with-doc:
                                     # server+client share module names -> @doc collides)
opam install wodoc                   # the odoc driver / theming
wodoc build --config doc/wodoc --label dev --out _doc-site/dev \
  --menu https://ocsigen.org/doc/menu.html
```

`wodoc build` runs `odoc_driver ocsigen-start --remap` on the installed package,
assembles every page into the Ocsigen site and writes the version redirect. Add
`--local` to fetch the shared `/css//img/` assets and preview offline.

> **Toolchain (CI).** The cross-library link fix lives in the
> [balat/odoc](https://github.com/balat/odoc) fork, which wodoc pulls in through
> its opam `pin-depends`. Do **not** pin `odoc` yourself — that conflicts with
> wodoc's pin. `wasm_of_ocaml-compiler` (a client-toolchain dep) needs a recent
> binaryen, installed by the `Set up Binaryen` CI step.

## Deployment (CI)

[`.github/workflows/doc.yml`](../.github/workflows/doc.yml) builds and publishes to
the project's **`gh-pages`** branch (served at `ocsigen.org/ocsigen-start/`). The
CI triggers **only on `master`**, so pushing any other branch never deploys:

- **push to `master`** → rebuilds and deploys the **`dev`** docs only.

Stable versions are **not** built by CI on push: they are published by the
`release` job (below). Each CI run replaces only the `dev/` directory; the other
version directories (and the live `demo/`) already on `gh-pages` are preserved.

## Releasing a stable version

The CI builds only `dev/`. To publish a stable version, trigger the
**Documentation** workflow's `release` job with the **version** input — either:

- **CLI** (from a clone of the repo): `gh workflow run doc.yml -f version=1.2.3`
- **GitHub UI**: repo → *Actions* → *Documentation* (left sidebar) → *Run workflow*
  (top-right) → set **version** (e.g. `1.2.3`) → *Run workflow*.

The `release` job freezes the current `dev/` docs as `/<version>/`, repoints the
`latest` symlink, writes the root redirect and refreshes `versions.json` — via
`wodoc release --from dev --version <version>`. No rebuild: the docs of a release
are exactly the `dev` docs at that point.

Equivalently, by hand on a `gh-pages` checkout:

```
wodoc release --site . --from dev --version <version>
git add -A && git commit -m "Release doc <version>" && git push
```
