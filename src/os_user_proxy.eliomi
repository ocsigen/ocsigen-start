(** This module implements a cache of user using <<a_api project="eliom" |
    module Eliom_cscache>> which allows to keep synchronized the cache between
    the client and the server.
    Even if there is a cache implemented in {!Os_user} to avoid to do database
    requests, this last one is implementing only server side. Same for
    {!Os_request_cache} which is also only server-side.
