(** Server to client notifications.
    
    This module is a version of [Eliom_notif] that fixes the types [identity] of
    [Eliom_notif.S] to [Os_types.User.id option] ([option] so that users can be
    notified that are not logged in). It takes care of (de)initialisation so
    [init] and [deinit] need not be called anymore. Also it adds a specialised
    version of [unlisten_user].

      expected without a value supplied for [sitedata] if called during a
